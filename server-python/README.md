# Flask-SQLAlchemy Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build and run a Flask application on your computer.
- Extend a Flask application to meet the unique requirements of different
  projects.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Web Framework**: software that is designed to support the development of
  web applications. Web frameworks provide built-in tools for generating web
  servers, turning Python objects into HTML, and more.
- **Extension**: a package or module that adds functionality to a Flask
  application that it does not have by default.
- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided
  by a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made
  over the internet.
- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)**: an interface between web servers
  and applications.
- **Template Engine**: software that takes in strings with tokenized
  values, replacing the tokens with their values as output in a web browser.

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `server/` folder.

Instructions begin here:

- Design a Flask application that displays information from a database created
  using Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate.
- `flask db init` has already been run. You will need to direct your Flask app
  to a database at `app.db`, create models, run a migration with `flask db
  revision --autogenerate -m'<your message>'` and create the database file with
  `flask db upgrade`.
- Your database should represent a zoo. There should be three tables: `animals`,
  `zookeepers`, and `enclosures`.
- The `Animal` model should contain a `name`, a `species`, a `zookeeper`, and
  an `enclosure`.
- The `Zookeeper` model should contain a `name`, a `birthday`, and a list of
  `animals` that they take care of.
- The `Enclosure` model should contain an `environment` (grass, sand, or water),
  an `open_to_visitors` boolean, and a list of `animals`.
- Your application should contain three views: `animal_by_id`,
  `zookeeper_by_id`, and `enclosure_by_id`. Their routes should be
  `animal/<int:id>`, `zookeeper/<int:id>`, and `enclosure/<int:id>`,
  respectively.
- Each view should display all attributes as line items (`ul`). If there is a
  one-to-many relationship, each of the many should have its own line item.
- A seed script, `server/seed.py`, has been provided to generate test data once your
  models have been built and migrated to a database. Make sure to run this so
  that there are resources for the test suite to visit.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
